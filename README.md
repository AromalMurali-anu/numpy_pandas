NumPy is “the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.” It offers:

A powerful N-dimensional array object

Sophisticated broadcasting functions

Integration tools for C/C++ and Fortran



Key Features:

Easy handling of missing data (NaN, NA, NaT)

Size mutability: DataFrames allow insertion and deletion of columns

Automatic and explicit data alignment

Flexible group-by operations (split-apply-combine)

Conversion between ragged/differently-indexed NumPy structures and DataFrames

Advanced indexing, merging, reshaping, pivoting, and hierarchical axis labeling

Robust I/O tools: CSV, Excel, databases, HDF5

Time-series functionality: date ranges, frequency conversions, moving windows, shifting, lagging
