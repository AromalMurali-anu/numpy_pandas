NumPy is “the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.” It offers:

A powerful N-dimensional array object

Sophisticated broadcasting functions

Integration tools for C/C++ and Fortran

Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
pandas is described as a “Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with ‘relational’ or ‘labeled’ data both easy and intuitive.” It serves as the fundamental, high-level building block for practical, real-world data analysis in Python.
